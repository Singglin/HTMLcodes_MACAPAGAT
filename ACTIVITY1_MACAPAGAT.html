        <h1> ADVENTURES NI MARK NA BANGIT </h1>
        <h2>My HTML Journey from <mark>Chaos</mark> to <mark>Cat Videos</mark></h2>
        <h3>Or, how I accidentally created a self-playing cat videos website (and almost lost my sanity)</h3>
     <p> Armed with boundless <i> enthusiasm </i> and <i> zero coding experience </i> , I embarked on my quest to conquer <mark> HTML. </mark> <br>
        Little did I know, my journey would be <i> less </i> <b> "Lord of the Rings" </b> and more <b> "Three Stooges" </b> </p>
    <p>My <ins> first website, </ins> lovingly named <b> "Brenda's Blossoming Boutique" </b>, resembled a digital <mark> Jackson Pollock </mark> painting. <br>
        Tags were <del> scattered </del> like <i> confetti, colors clashed </i> like a sunset on <mark> Mars .</mark> and the navigation system could only be <br> 
        described as <b> "whimsical" </b> <sub> (by a very generous browser) </sub> <br> </p>
    <p> Determined to redeem myself, I tackled a <b> "simple </b> project: <mark> a cat video gallery. </mark> What ensued was a <i> hilarious </i> <br> 
        <sup> (and slightly terrifiying) </sup> <ins> ballet of misplacewd semicolons, </ins> ,<ins> rogue line breaks, </ins> and <ins> images </ins> that dances uncontrollably <br>
        <del> across </del> the screen. At one point, my entire website transformed into an <i> auto-playing cat video slideshow, </i> much to <br>
        the amusement <sub> (and slightly concern) </sub> of my family. </p>
    <p> After <ins> severasl meltdown, </ins> <ins> countless tutorials, </ins> and <ins> gallons of coffee. </ins> I finally managed to wrangle my code into <i> submission. </i> <br> 
        My cat video gallery wan't exactly <b> "elegant" </b>, but it functioned <sup> (mostly) </sup>. And hey, at least I learned that even the <mark> clumsiest <br>
        coder </mark> can create something... <i> interesting .</i> So here's to <mark> Brenda's Blossoming Boutique </mark> . <mark> <i> the self-playing cat video video extravaganza </i></mark> <br> 
        and the <del> never-ending </del> quest to master the art of <mark> <b> HTML! </b></mark> </p>
